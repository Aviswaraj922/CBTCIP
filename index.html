                <p>I have always been fascinated by the power of UI and how they can influence and inform people. My journey began during my high school years when I started making small webpages on various topics.

                </ul>
                <p>With all these skills, I have also done some co-curricular activities which helps me to grow everywhere</p>

                </ul>
                <!-- <p>When I'm not writing, you can find me exploring new technologies, reading about the latest trends in digital marketing, or hiking in the mountains. I believe that a balanced life is key to creativity and productivity.</p>
                <p>I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow. Feel free to reach out if you would like to collaborate or learn more about my work.</p> -->
